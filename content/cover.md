## Developer Advocate

Hello [company] Team,

I appreciate your consideration. I have been a full-stack software engineer for over a decade and have a passion for developer advocacy. I have a wide range of experience in programming languages and technologies, which has enabled me to relate to most developers and provide guidance on a wide range of issues. I live and breathe open-source and love to grow the developer communities around great OSS. In my current role as Head of Developer Experience at Aklivity, I have created high-quality technical content and led community engagement efforts, ensuring a seamless onboarding experience for developers. I would fit right in with the Temporal developer community and team to continue empowering other developers.

Cheers,

AJ

## Cloud Native

Hello Apollo Team,

I appreciate your consideration. I am a golang enthusiast who has been trapped in a Java dev's body.  I have spent some time polishing my old side project, Gohlay, to prove my affinity for Go and passion for open-source. I have been a cloud-native aficionado since the moment I learned there was a world outside of VMs and server racks. My passions for event streaming and microservices fit nicely in the cloud.

I love working for a global company and have been searching for a cloud-native company based in Europe. Reading the company culture was a breath of fresh air. I worked with the global team at WSO2, based in Sri Lanka, and was promoted to manage the Developer Relations team that spanned from Sri Lanka to Brazil. I managed both technical and nontechnical members of a 17-person team. Outside of direct management experience, I have served in a leadership role for the majority of my development career.

With all that said, I would love to talk more about joining the team in any position I can fill to help fulfill the company's vision.

Cheers,

AJ

Hello AiB team,

I appreciate your consideration for the Senior Developer Relations Engineer position. You can see from my resume that I have direct experience with all of the Job responsibility areas you have listed. I created the DevRel teams at both Aklivity and WSO2. I was the primary author for all of the documentation and examples for the Zilla open-source project. I have recently release my own open-source golang project and am working with the Open Telementry group.

My experience covers a majority of the technical requirements, with a noticeable gap in web3 experience. I am applying despite that because I believe an effective Developer Advocate is firstly able to learn quickly. I know I can be proficient with the needs of a web3 community very quickly. More importantly the skills and experience needed to interact with an open-source developer community aren't easily taught. As with any dev not trapped in a server room, I am familiar with blockchain and believe the future of technology will depend on decentralization. I know I will add significant value to the AiB team and AtomOne.

Cheers,

AJ

Senior Software Design Engineer


At first glance of my CV, you wouldn't think a golang position is the next step in my career, but I assure you I am a golang enthusiast who has been trapped in a Java dev's body. When I found gRPC and protobufs back in 2016 I fell in love. They are a hard sell to old Java devs so I have been searching for a place where my passion for go and protobufs can thrive. I have been a cloud-native aficionado since the moment I learned there was a world outside of VMs and server racks. My passions for event streaming, golang, and microservices fit nicely in the cloud.
