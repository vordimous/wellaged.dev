Hello Temporal Team,

Thank you for you consideration for the Staff Developer Advocate position at Temporal. I have been a full stack software engineer for almost a decade and a new passion for developer advocacy. The majority of my work was writing distributed Java backends making me well-prepared to engage with the Java developer community. I also have a wide range of experience in other languages and technologies making me able to relate to most developers and provide guidance in a wide range of issues. I live and breath open-source and love to grow the developer communities around great OSS. In my current role as Head of Developer Experience at Aklivity, I have created high-quality technical content and led community engagement efforts, ensuring a seamless onboarding experience for developers. I would fit right in with the Temporal developer community and team to continue empowering other developers.

Cheers,

AJ


Hello Source Team,

I appreciate your consideration for the Lead Developer Relation Engineer. At first glance of my CV, you wouldn't think a golang position is the next step in my career, but I assure you I am a golang enthusiast who has been trapped in a Java devs body. I have spent some time polishing my old side project, Gohlay, as proof of my affinity for Go and passion for open-source. I have been a cloud-native aficionado since the moment I learned there was a world outside of VMs and server racks. My passions for event streaming and microservices fit nicely in the cloud.

I love working for a global company and have been searching for a cloud-native company based in Europe. Reading the Civo culture was a breath of fresh air. I worked with the IAM team at WSO2, based in Sri Lanka, and was promoted to manage the Developer Relations team that spanned from Sri Lanka to Brazil. I managed both technical and nontechnical members of a 17-person team. Outside of direct management experience, I have served in a leadership role for the majority of my development career.

With all that said, I would love to talk more about joining the Source DevRel team or any position I can fill to help fulfill the Source vision for decentralized tools and infrastructure.

Cheers,

AJ
