Developer Experience is tied to the Product

Product design impacts Experience

- Marketing KPIs don't impact Developer success

DevRel was born in marketing. The elusive developer make getting in touch much more difficult and special skills were required to build a relationship with trust. Now any typical marketing incetive goes against a DevRel building that trust.

- Product docs shouldn't be managed by engineers

Documentation is the framework that all other developer resources are built on top of. they should be aligned closely with what the product is doing and needs to keep pace with changes and advancements. Technical writers should stay close to the product team and the product team should be working closely with the technical writers. They are both working towards a better developer experience. Technical writing should be under DevRel and DevRel should have the same goals as the product team.
