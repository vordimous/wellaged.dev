### Team

* My goal is the make the most of your time and not require most of your time.  
* I trust you to manage your own time. You don’t need to clear with me in advance your time AFK or OOO.  
* 1:1 are for the team and will be documented privately with you, me, and your lead. Any feedback on PAR reviews will come from this document.  
* Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone. All DevEx is the DevRel team's focus.

### Leaders

* I don’t need to approve or know about everything, your judgment is important on when I can help. If you think I will be surprised then I need to be updated.  
* You will focus on your team's success, I will work with you to create and manage what success looks like. It won’t be vanity metrics.  
* New ideas are important, we will foster and evaluate, but decide and move on.  
* OSS is our main example. We can’t compare ourselves to companies more than double our size. Less is more.

### Management Style

* Leave, Trust people to decide on good PTO/OOO for individual days. Only require pre-approval for longer than 3 days. Having days on the calendar 2 weeks ahead of time is preferred.  
* 1:1s note-taking will include all important details and early feedback  
* PAR reviews will only include details from 1:1 notes  
* Plan work as much ahead of time as possible, loose sprint implementation  
* Growth day per sprint, flexible ex. two half days

Advice

* Explain WHY you need people to do something
