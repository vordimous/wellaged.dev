# Developer Relations belongs in Product

- Developer Experience is tied to the Product

- Product design impacts Experience

- Marketing KPIs don't impact Developer success

    DevRel was born in marketing. The elusive developer make getting in touch much more difficult and special skills were required to build a relationship with trust. Now any typical marketing incetive goes against a DevRel building that trust.

- Product docs shouldn't be managed by engineers

    Documentation is the framework that all other developer resources are built on top of. they should be aligned closely with what the product is doing and needs to keep pace with changes and advancements. Technical writers should stay close to the product team and the product team should be working closely with the technical writers. They are both working towards a better developer experience. Technical writing should be under DevRel and DevRel should have the same goals as the product team.

- The biggest conduit for the Developers relationship with your product is your docs

    Documentation is the Human API for your product. People who are interacting with the Devs that use your docs should be maintaining it. Product engineers are not a good sample of the Developers who use your product.

- DevRel's primary goal is to get Developers to the right place in the docs

    DevRel should be highlighting features and offering usable demonstrations for Devs to find and run with. the next stop in that marathon is your docs. DevRel's incentives should aline with the Product documentation which should align with the product.

- Marketing is entertainment, DevRel is substance
  - Entertain/Engage and inform: Marketing
  - Inform and guide to success: DevRel

- Dev Marketing is a matchmaking service and DevRel is the wingman
  - Devrel makes sure your first interaction is meaningful
  - Marketing makes sure there is a first interaction



## Developer Experience is Tied to the Product

As we strive for better developer experiences, it's easy to get caught up in the idea that dev relations (DevRel) and product are separate entities. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, developer experience is deeply tied to the product itself.

## Product Design Impacts Experience

The design of our products has a direct impact on how developers interact with them. A well-designed product can make or break the developer's experience. Conversely, a poorly designed product can lead to frustration and abandonment. As such, it's essential that product designers prioritize developer experience alongside business goals.

## Marketing KPIs Don't Impact Developer Success

One of the biggest misconceptions about DevRel is that marketing metrics like engagement rates or conversion numbers are directly tied to developer success. However, this couldn't be further from the truth. Developers don't care about your marketing metrics; they care about using and enjoying your product.

## DevRel Was Born in Marketing

Historically, dev relations have been managed by marketing teams. This has led to a culture of making developers feel special and exclusive. While this may have worked in the past, it's no longer effective. Modern marketing incentives often prioritize short-term gains over long-term relationships.

Today, DevRel is about building trust and fostering a community around your product. This requires a different approach than traditional marketing tactics. Instead of relying on gimmicks or special perks, we need to focus on providing value and support that resonates with developers.

## Product Docs Shouldn't Be Managed by Engineers

Documentation is the backbone of any developer's experience. It provides the framework for understanding how your product works, what features are available, and how to use them effectively. However, many product teams still manage documentation themselves, often resulting in a mismatch between the product's capabilities and the documentation's content.

Technical writers should be aligned closely with the product team to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date and accurate. This requires close collaboration and communication between the product team, technical writers, and DevRel.

## The Biggest Conduit for Developer Relationships

Documentation is often overlooked as a critical component of the developer relationship. However, it's not just any documentation – it needs to be human-centered, accessible, and informative. Documentation should serve as the primary conduit for developers interacting with your product.

Product engineers are not the best representation of the developers who use your product. They may have limited visibility into real-world problems or workflows. Instead, technical writers and DevRel teams should focus on creating documentation that resonates with the broader developer community.

## DevRel's Primary Goal is to Get Developers to the Right Place in Docs

The ultimate goal of dev relations should be to guide developers to the most relevant and useful resources within your product's documentation. This may seem obvious, but it requires a deep understanding of the developer ecosystem and the challenges they face.

Incentivizing DevRel teams to align with product documentation is crucial for creating a cohesive and effective experience for developers. By prioritizing documentation quality and accessibility, we can build trust, foster engagement, and drive adoption.

## Conclusion

Developer relations belongs in product because it's deeply tied to the developer experience. Product design, marketing metrics, and documentation all play critical roles in shaping the developer relationship. By recognizing the interconnectedness of these components, we can create a more cohesive and effective DevRel strategy that prioritizes value, trust, and community.

Let's put an end to siloed approaches and focus on building a unified front for developers who interact with our products. By doing so, we can unlock new levels of engagement, adoption, and success – both for developers and the product itself.
