# Developer Relations Belongs in Product: Why Alignment Drives Better Outcomes

The role of Developer Relations (DevRel) has long been debated: Is it a marketing function, a technical advocacy team, or something else entirely? While DevRel historically emerged from marketing departments, its true home lies within **Product**. Here's why.

## Developer Experience is a Product-Centric Discipline

Developer Experience (DevEx) isnâ€™t just about slick APIs or polished SDKsâ€”itâ€™s the sum of every interaction a developer has with your product. This includes onboarding flows, error messages, documentation, and even community support. These touchpoints are **direct extensions of the product itself**, not just ancillary marketing materials. When DevRel sits within Product, it ensures that the developerâ€™s journey is treated as a core part of the product strategy, not an afterthought.

### Product Design Shapes Developer Experience

A well-designed product minimizes friction for developers. For example:

- A confusing API schema forces developers to waste time deciphering endpoints.
- Poorly designed SDKs lead to frustration and abandonment.
- Inconsistent versioning erodes trust.

DevRel teams embedded in Product can advocate for developer-centric design decisions early in the development cycle. They act as the voice of the end-user, ensuring that the product is built with real-world use cases in mind.

## Why Marketing KPIs Conflict with Developer Success

DevRel was born in marketing because developers were seen as a "hard-to-reach" audience. Traditional marketing tacticsâ€”lead generation, conversion rates, and click-through metricsâ€”donâ€™t translate to developer success. In fact, they often undermine trust. For example:
- **Gating documentation behind forms** frustrates developers seeking quick answers.
- **Prioritizing buzzwords over substance** erodes credibility.

DevRelâ€™s missionâ€”to build trust and empower developersâ€”is fundamentally misaligned with marketingâ€™s focus on acquisition and growth. When DevRel reports to Marketing, it risks becoming a lead-gen tool rather than a champion for developers.

## Documentation: The Foundation of Developer Experience

### Product Docs Should Guided by Engineers

In the fast paced race to keep up with product improvements and user demands, DevRel and the Technical Writers within the team are the drivers while Engineers navigate. Engineers are experts at building products, not explaining them. Documentation requires a different skill set: clarity, empathy, and an understanding of diverse user personas. **Technical writers**, not engineers, should own documentation. However, they must work *alongside* the Product team to:

- Stay synchronized with product updates.
- Translate technical details into actionable guidance.
- Iterate based on developer feedback.

When documentation lives under DevRel (which itself aligns with Product), it becomes a living resource that evolves with the product.

### Documentation is the "Human API"

Your docs are the primary interface developers use to interact with your product. Think of them as the **Human API**â€”a bridge between your productâ€™s capabilities and the developerâ€™s goals. If this API is poorly designed, developers will struggle to adopt your product, no matter how powerful it is.

Product engineers are not the target audience for documentation. Developers using your product may have varying levels of expertise, work in different environments, or prioritize different use cases. Technical writers and DevRel teams, armed with direct feedback from the community, are better equipped to create inclusive, effective docs.

## DevRelâ€™s Role: Guiding Developers to the Right Resources

DevRelâ€™s primary goal isnâ€™t to entertain or generate leadsâ€”itâ€™s to **guide developers to success**. This means:

- Creating tutorials and demos that highlight key features.
- Directing developers to relevant documentation.
- Acting as a feedback loop between users and Product.

When DevRel and Product share goals, incentives align. For example, a Product team focused on adoption will prioritize features that solve real problems, while DevRel ensures developers can easily find and implement those features via docs and resources.

## Marketing vs. DevRel: Entertainment vs. Substance

- **Marketingâ€™s Role**: Entertain, engage, and attract. Think viral tweets, swag, and event sponsorships.
- **DevRelâ€™s Role**: Inform, educate, and retain. Think in-depth workshops, troubleshooting guides, and API deep dives.

Marketing creates the first impression; DevRel ensures the second, third, and hundredth interactions are meaningful. Imagine Marketing as a matchmaker and DevRel as the wingman: Marketing gets developers in the door, but DevRel ensures they stay.

## The Path Forward: Integrate DevRel with Product

To maximize developer success:

1. **Move DevRel under Product** to align incentives with user outcomes.
2. **Empower technical writers** as first-class stakeholders in product development.
3. **Treat documentation as a core product feature**, not a support artifact.

When DevRel and Product work in lockstep, developers winâ€”and so does your product. ðŸš€
