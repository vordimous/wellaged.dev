I built a Kafka message scheduling tool that also works with Redpanda.

https://github.com/vordimous/gohlay

Gohlay has been a side/passion project on my back burner for too long, and I finally had the time to polish it up enough for community feedback. The idea came from a discussion around a business need. I am curious how this tool could be used in other Redpanda workflows. I had fun writing it; if someone finds it useful, that is a win-win.

You can check out the [redpanda example](https://github.com/vordimous/gohlay/tree/main/examples/redpanda) to see Gohlay working with Redpanda.

Any feedback or ideas for improvement are welcome!
