# Site description.
description = "I am a full-stack cloud application engineer and developer advocate passionate about distributed cloud applications. I am a golang enthusiast trapped in a Java dev's body. I have been a cloud-native aficionado since the moment I learned there was a world outside of VMs and server racks. My passions for event streaming and microservices fit nicely in the cloud. I love working for a global company, working with both technical and non-technical team members. I have served in a leadership role for the majority of my development career. In any role, I will contribute to the success of a software project by advocating internally and externally for all developers."
